# Instructions: HELPmiss (Data Verbs) Activity


## Grading

- Assignment is worth a total of 15 points
- [5 points] Task 1: Data Description
- [3 points] Task 2: Basic Summaries
- [5 points] Task 3: Group Summaries
- [2 points] Task 4: Data Viz & Observations
    - one point for including a useful plot with at least 3 variables represented
    - one point for narrative description of observations from your plot


## Instructions 
- Task prompts are shown in *italics* in the .Rmd file
- You must make 4 commits pushed to your provided GitHub Repo for the assignment, or the assignment will be assessed a 2 point penalty.
- Make sure you run all R code chunks regularly.  Code submitted without accompanying results will be penalized (e.g., `ggplot` code for a plot is shown, but no plot is present in the R Notebook).

## Submit

Submit your completed R Notebook to Canvas before the deadline.


## Tips

- Feel free to use interactive graphics capabilities from the `esquisse` or `mosaic` packages to generate ggplot code for any data visualizations to be included.
- In RStudio, each R code chunk includes three buttons in the top right corner: (1) a gear for chunk settings, (2) a gray triangle on a green rectangle which runs all code chunks prior to the current chunk, (3) a 'play button' to run the code in the current chunk.  Use buttons (2) & (3) often.
